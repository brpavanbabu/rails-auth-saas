# 🔒 WHAT TO INCLUDE IN PUBLIC VS PRIVATE

## ✅ PUBLIC REPO (What People See):
- Product code (`app/`, `config/`, `db/migrate/`, `test/`)
- README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING
- Documentation for users

## ❌ KEEP PRIVATE (Your Internal Stuff):
- Marketing strategy docs
- Market research
- Launch plans
- Working files
- Agent transcripts

---

## 🎯 CHOOSE ONE:

**Option A:** Create separate clean repo (RECOMMENDED)
- New folder with only product code
- Your working folder stays private
- Clean, professional

**Option B:** Update .gitignore in current repo
- Hide internal files
- Faster
- Less clean

**Which do you want?**
