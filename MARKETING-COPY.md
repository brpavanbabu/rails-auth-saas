## Full Description

### Stop Building Auth From Scratch

Every Rails SaaS needs authentication. But if you're building for **healthcare, fintech, or education**, you also need:

- HIPAA audit logs (healthcare)
- Transaction logging (fintech)  
- LMS integration (education)
- Enterprise SSO (B2B customers)
- Multi-tenancy (team accounts)

**This template has it all.**

---

### What Makes This Different?

Most Rails auth templates give you basic login/signup. **This goes further**:

✅ **Two-Factor Authentication** (TOTP, QR codes, backup codes)  
✅ **OAuth 2.0** (Google, GitHub ready - add more in 5 minutes)  
✅ **Enterprise SSO** (SAML 2.0 for Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin)  
✅ **Multi-Tenancy** (account-based isolation for B2B SaaS)  
✅ **HIPAA Module** (audit logs, PHI access tracking, session timeouts)  
✅ **Fintech Module** (transaction logs, security events, fraud detection)  
✅ **EdTech LTI 1.3** (Canvas/Moodle integration, grade passback)  

Plus: Professional UI, responsive design, rate limiting, magic links, remember me, password resets.
